Project Title:
Design and Deployment of a Scalable Website with Integrated Backup, Recovery, and Cloud Services using AWS

Project Description:
This project focuses on the end-to-end design, development, and deployment of a responsive and scalable website hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). In addition to the front-end and back-end development of the site, the project integrates robust cloud-based backup and disaster recovery solutions to ensure data resilience, security, and high availability.

Key Objectives:

                            Website Design and Development:

Develop a modern, user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a suitable back-end framework (e.g., Node.js, Python Flask/Django, or PHP).
Ensure responsive design for compatibility across all devices.
Implement user authentication, form handling, and database integration.
Cloud Infrastructure Setup on AWS
Host the website using Amazon EC2 or AWS Elastic Beanstalk for automatic scaling and deployment.
Use Amazon S3 for storing static assets (images, scripts, CSS files, etc.).
Configure Amazon RDS or DynamoDB for back-end database management.
Backup and Recovery Planning:
Set up automated backups using AWS Backup for RDS, EC2, and EBS volumes.
Utilize S3 versioning and Lifecycle policies for secure, cost-effective data backup and retention.
Enable AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config for activity logging and resource configuration tracking.


                Disaster Recovery Implementation:
Design a disaster recovery plan using AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) to minimize downtime and data loss.
Implement cross-region replication for critical data to ensure availability in case of regional failure
Regularly test backup restoration and failover scenarios to validate the disaster recovery strategy.

               Security and Monitoring:
Apply IAM roles and policies for secure access management.
Use AWS Shield and AWS WAF to protect the website against DDoS and common web attacks.
Monitor performance and resource usage with Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Trusted Advisor.

Expected Outcomes:

A fully functional website deployed on AWS with high scalability and availability.

Reliable and automated backup and disaster recovery mechanisms.

Enhanced security and data protection practices based on AWS best practices.

Tools and Services Used:

Amazon EC2, S3, RDS/DynamoDB, AWS Backup, AWS DRS, CloudWatch, IAM, CloudTrail, AWS WAF, AWS Shield, and AWS Route 53.



            Technologies Used:

Frontend:

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript

Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS (for responsive design)

      Backend:

Node.js / Python (Flask or Django) / PHP

Express.js (if using Node.js)

            Database:

Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL alternative)
Cloud & Infrastructure (AWS):
Amazon EC2 – for hosting the website
Amazon S3 – for static file storage and backup
AWS Elastic Beanstalk – for simplified deployment (optional)
Amazon Route 53 – for domain management and DNS routing
Amazon CloudFront – for CDN and performance optimization
AWS Backup – for automated backup management
AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery – for failover and recovery
Amazon CloudWatch – for monitoring and alerts
AWS IAM – for access control and permissions
AWS WAF & AWS Shield – for web application security
AWS CloudTrail – for activity logging and auditing










Challenges Overcome:

                             Setting Up Scalable Cloud Infrastructure:
Initially faced difficulties in configuring and deploying AWS EC2 instances and Elastic Beanstalk environments. Overcame this by studying AWS documentation, using CloudFormation templates, and automating the setup using AWS CLI.
Managing Secure Access and Permissions:
Dealt with complex IAM role configurations and permission errors during deployment and backup automation. Learned to apply the principle of least privilege and properly assign policies to services and users.
Implementing Automated Backup and Disaster Recovery:
Faced challenges integrating AWS Backup with multiple services and ensuring consistent recovery points. Solved this by creating backup plans and testing recovery simulations with AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery.

                             Handling Data Consistency and Availability:

Managing consistent backups and syncing between primary and secondary regions was tricky. Used S3 cross-region replication and scheduled snapshots for RDS to maintain data integrity and high availability. 



                                Ensuring Website Security:

Protecting the site from common threats like DDoS and SQL injection was a challenge. Addressed this by configuring AWS WAF rules, enabling Shield Standard, and securing APIs with token-based authentication.

                               Disaster Recovery Testing:

Initial tests revealed long recovery times. Improved the recovery strategy by pre-configuring target environments and automating the failover process using AWS DRS.
